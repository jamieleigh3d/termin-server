"""SQLite storage provider — first-party plugin against the v0.9
Storage contract surface.

Wraps the file-level SQL helpers in `termin_runtime.storage` behind
the StorageProvider Protocol. The wrapping is intentional and small:
the SQL stays in storage.py (one source of truth, well-tested,
already used by a handful of legacy callers); this class is the
contract façade that the rest of the runtime now talks to.

Loaded through the same ProviderRegistry mechanism third-party
providers use — see register_sqlite_storage below. Per BRD §10
"One loading path for all providers", there is no special-cased
"built-in" code path.

Provider boundary discipline (BRD §6.2 "Provider's job is small"):
  - This class does SQL/persistence and nothing else.
  - Event publishing, error routing through TerminAtor, and HTTP
    status code translation are RUNTIME concerns. The runtime
    calls these methods, then publishes events / raises 404 /
    translates errors itself in the route/page handler.
  - In particular, the legacy storage.create_record() / update_record()
    / delete_record() functions had baked-in event publishing and
    TerminAtor calls. The provider intentionally does NOT call
    those legacy entrypoints — it calls the lower-level SQL helpers
    (insert_raw, update_fields, etc.) so the side effects stay out
    of the provider boundary.
