    """v0.9.2 close-out: drain pending tasks AND threadsafe
    callbacks before closing a background asyncio loop so
    aiosqlite worker threads don't raise "Event loop is closed"
    tracebacks at idle (the symptom JL hit during a live
    ``termin serve`` session, especially on the refusal path
    which does extra db work — audit write + refusal-append).

    The race: each ``<X>.<Y>.appended`` event spawns a thread
    with a fresh asyncio loop running ``execute_compute`` to
    completion. ``aiosqlite.Connection.close()`` puts a stop
    sentinel on its worker queue and awaits the close result —
    but DOES NOT join the worker thread. So between
    ``await db.close()`` returning and the worker thread fully
    exiting (after delivering its final ``call_soon_threadsafe``
    result back to the loop), there's a window where
    ``loop.close()`` would cut the worker off.

    Mitigation, in order:
      1. Cancel pending asyncio.Tasks (orphan fire-and-forget
         coroutines).
      2. Drive the loop briefly via ``run_until_complete`` on the
         cancellation gather + ``shutdown_asyncgens``. These
         incidentally drain pending ``call_soon_threadsafe``
         callbacks because run_until_complete iterates the loop.
      3. Explicit ``asyncio.sleep(0.1)`` to give worker threads
         that haven't yet delivered their final callback ~100ms
         to do so. 100ms is empirically enough for aiosqlite's
         per-connection worker to fully exit; cheaper than the
         alternative (introspecting worker threads to join them
         directly, which is implementation-specific and
         brittle).
      4. Close.

    Best-effort throughout — never raises; on a closed loop it's
    a no-op.

        Builds the payload by CEL-evaluating the body expression and
        any metadata-tail clauses against the same context the predicate
        used (which already has `appended_entry` bound, plus the parent
        record fields). Then dispatches through the shared
        :func:`_do_append` helper so the new entry is identical in
        shape to one written via the REST or WebSocket surface — same
        validation, same event publication, same audit hooks.

        The When-rule append inherits the upstream principal that
        triggered the original append; the audit trail attributes the
        synthetic entry to the user whose action set off the chain.
        Row-filter is None — When-rules are server-side and not gated
        by per-row ownership rules (a server-side actor doesn't
        impersonate a row owner).

        Loop prevention is structural, not enforced here: the OVERSEER
        pattern relies on the kind discriminator
        (`appended_entry.kind == "user"` predicate vs `system_event`
        injection). The :func:`_do_append` helper publishes another
        `<content>.<field>.appended` event for the synthetic entry,
        which re-enters this dispatch loop — but with
        `appended_entry.kind == "system_event"` the predicate returns
        False so no re-trigger. See §13.2 ("Action ordering ... the
