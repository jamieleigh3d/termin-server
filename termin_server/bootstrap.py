"""v0.9 Phase 5b.4 B' plumbing: bootstrap-payload builder.

Per the Spectrum-provider design Q2 decision (B' = server-authoritative
+ JS-as-renderer / LiveView-shaped), the runtime ships a JSON
bootstrap payload that the client-side provider bundle uses to render
the page. The payload is delivered two ways:

  1. Embedded in the initial HTML response (first page load), inside
     a `<script>window.__termin_bootstrap = {...}</script>` data
     island. (Future commit — HTML shell mode.)
  2. Returned from `GET /_termin/page-data?path=<path>` for SPA
     navigation. (Endpoint registered in
     `register_page_data_endpoint`.)

Either way the shape is identical:

    {
      "component_tree_ir": <PageEntry IR>,
      "bound_data": <records keyed by content source>,
      "principal_context": <id, scopes, preferences, ...>,
      "subscriptions_to_open": [<channel_id>, ...]
    }

Trust-plane invariants per BRD #2 + BRD #3:

  - Confidentiality redaction (rows + fields) applies *before*
    payload assembly. The runtime is authoritative; the client
    sees only what the principal is allowed to see.
  - Ownership cascade (Phase 6a.6) — same. The list_records-shaped
    queries already go through the storage layer, which applies
    row filtering for owned content.
  - Subscription channel IDs in `subscriptions_to_open` are the
    coarse `content.<X>` prefix; the WebSocket fan-out path
    (`broadcast_to_subscribers`) re-applies the ownership cascade
    per-event.
  - Role-scoped page resolution: when the same slug has multiple
    pages keyed by role, we pick the page matching the user's
    role. No matching page → returns None → endpoint 404s.

# ── Page-IR resolution ──

def _resolve_page_for(ir: dict, path: str, user: dict) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Resolve a URL path to a single PageEntry IR for the
    requesting user.

    Path matching is by slug (PageEntry.slug). Two cases:

      * **Single variant for a slug.** Return it regardless of the
        page's `role` metadata — the page UI renders for any user,
        and auth is enforced by the data layer (CRUD scope checks,
        confidentiality redaction, ownership cascade). This matches
        how the SSR pipeline already behaves: the page route serves
        the rendered template to any user, and the data table is
        empty when the user lacks the read scope. Anonymous users
        landing on a role-restricted page see the page chrome and
        an empty surface — they switch roles via the role-switcher.

      * **Multiple variants of the same slug** (role-scoped variants —
        e.g., a page for `Anonymous` AND a different page for `alice`
        at the same slug). Pick the variant matching the user's role.
        If no variant matches, fall back to the first one (so the
        user at least sees something — same SSR-equivalent behavior).
        A bug from 2026-04-29 had this branch return None; it caused
        the page-route cut-over to 404 for any user whose role didn't
        explicitly match the page's role metadata.

    The rule: if the page-contract provider declares `csr` but not
    `ssr` in its render_modes, the per-slug page route serves the B'
    shell HTML instead of the SSR pipeline — the provider doesn't
    implement SSR, so legacy Tailwind rendering would just be a
    fallback the bundle then has to reconcile against.

    When no provider is bound (default), or when the bound provider
    supports both modes (Tailwind once it adds CSR), or when the
    bound provider is SSR-only (GOV.UK), this returns False and the
    SSR pipeline runs. Apps can still hit `/_termin/shell?path=...`
    explicitly even in those cases.

    The check is per-runtime, not per-page: today every `presentation-
    base.page` contract resolves through the same provider. When 5b.3
    full per-contract dispatch lands, this can extend to per-page-IR
    inspection. For v0.9 5b.4 the namespace-or-contract binding model
