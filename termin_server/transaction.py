"""Transaction staging for Compute execution (snapshot isolation).

Provides a staging layer that intercepts reads and writes during Compute
execution. Reads go to production unless the transaction has written that
value (read-your-writes). Writes go to staging. After completion,
postconditions are evaluated against the staging state. If all pass,
writes are committed to production in write order (journaling).

Usage:
    tx = Transaction(storage_adapter)
    tx.write("employees", 42, {"salary": 100000})
    tx.write("employees", 43, {"salary": 90000})
    record = tx.read("employees", 42)  # returns staged value

    # Evaluate postconditions...
    if postconditions_pass:
        await tx.commit(db)   # writes to prod in order
    else:
        tx.rollback()         # discards staging
